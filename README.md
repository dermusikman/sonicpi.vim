# sonicpi.vim

Everything works, and I am so grateful that this plugin has met a need for the community, but I am not actively working on features. I accept pull requests and invite contributions, but also wish to make you aware of [vim-sonic-pi](https://github.com/lilyinstarlight/vim-sonic-pi), which is a more active fork with cool additional features, and supports newer features offered in recent releases of [Sonic Pi](http://www.sonic-pi.net/).


#### Requirements

The sonicpi vim plugin requires the following:

* An installation of [Sonic Pi 2.4+](http://www.sonic-pi.net/).

* A tool to interface with Sonic Pi. The default is [sonic-pi-cli](https://github.com/Widdershin/sonic-pi-cli/).


### Features

The plugin enables itself when Sonic Pi is running and the Ruby filetype is initiated (`let g:sonicpi_enabled = 0` to disable), and provides the following features:

* `<leader>r` - send current buffer or visual mode line selection to sonicpi

* `<leader>S` - send stop message to sonicpi

* Contextual autocompletion of Sonic Pi terms with omnicomplete (`<C-x><C-o>` by default). That is, if you have `synth :zawa,` in the line, omnicomplete will provide parameter names for `:zawa`, et al!

* Extension of Ruby syntax to include Sonic Pi terms


### Installation

Prerequisites: [Sonic Pi 2.4+](http://www.sonic-pi.net/), and [sonic-pi-cli](https://github.com/Widdershin/sonic-pi-cli/) or similar.

If you use [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) (and you should), simply clone this repo into `~/.vim/bundle/` like so:

`git clone https://github.com/dermusikman/sonicpi.vim.git`

Whenever Sonic Pi is running, and you haven't disabled the `g:sonicpi_enabled` flag in your configs, the plugin will activate. Otherwise, it's a normal Ruby session!


### Configuration

`g:sonicpi_keymaps_enabled` can be used to disable the default keybindings.

`g:sonicpi_command` can be used to configure what tool is used to send the
code to Sonic Pi. The default is `sonic_pi`.

`g:sonicpi_send` and `g:sonicpi_stop` can be used to adjust the arguments sent
to `g:sonicpi_command`. The default values are `g:sonicpi_send = ''` and
`g:sonicpi_stop = 'stop'`.

`g:vim_redraw`, if true (such as by setting it to `1`), will redraw the screen
after the stop command instead of waiting for output. Its default value is
`0`.

As an example, to use
[`sonic-pi-tool`](https://github.com/lpil/sonic-pi-tool/), the following
`.vimrc` settings would work:

```vim
let g:sonicpi_command = 'sonic-pi-tool'
let g:sonicpi_send = 'eval-stdin'
let g:sonicpi_stop = 'stop'
let g:vim_redraw = 1
```

## Sonic Pi interfacing tools

* [sonic-pi-cli](https://github.com/Widdershin/sonic-pi-cli/). The default.

* [sonic-pi-tool](https://github.com/lpil/sonic-pi-tool). Written in Rust, and more responsive than sonic-pi-cli.

* [sonic-pi-pipe](https://github.com/lpil/sonic-pi-tool/tree/master/old). An
older version of `sonic-pi-tool` with less functionality written in Go.

### TODO

* ~~Fix autocomplete~~
* ~~Make contextual autocomplete (e.g., a list of samples follows `samples`)~~
* ~~Add movement for Sonic Pi style files, ala [ruby.vim](https://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby/blob/master/doc/vim-ruby.txt)'s modifications~~ (Now we stay in the Ruby filetype)
* ~~Extend Ruby syntax to incorporate Sonic Pi directives~~
* ~~Update for Sonic Pi 2.4~~
* Add named notes (e.g., `:c4`, `:e2`) and chords (e.g., `sus4`, `m7+5`)
* Add oddball contexts beyond the sounds. For instance, we've added the "spread" context to include `rotate:`
